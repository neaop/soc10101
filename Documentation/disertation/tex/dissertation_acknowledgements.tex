\section*{Acknowledgements}
	\noindent
	I would like to offer my gratitude to the supervisor of this project, Professor Jon Kerridge, for his initial suggesting of the project, as well as all the support, ideas and guidance he has offered over its progression.
	\\\\
	I want to thank the friends and peers I have made over the years I have spent at Napier, without whose inputs, constructive criticism and distractions, the outcome of this project would have been much different (for better, or for worse).
	\\\\
	Thanks too, to my caring family, for their constant belief in my abilities, even when I doubted it.
	\\\\
	And a final thank you to my wonderful girlfriend, for her unparalleled support, unwavering hope, and willingness to proofread, without which this dissertation would be illegible.
