abstract = {Children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) have difficulty imagining movements such that they conform to the customary temporal constraints of real performance. We examined whether this ability is influenced by the choice of task used to elicit motor imagery (MI). Performance of typically developing (TD) (. n=. 30) and children with DCD (. n=. 30) was compared on two tasks: the Visually Guided Pointing Task (VGPT) and the Computerized Virtual Radial Fitts Task (C-VRFT). Since the VGPT places higher demands on executive functions like working memory but requires less spatial planning, we reasoned that the C-VRFT would provide a purer measure of motor imagery (or simulation). Based on our earlier work, we predicted that imagery deficits in DCD would more likely manifest on the C-VRFT. Results showed high correlations between tasks in terms of executed and imagined movement time suggest that both tasks measure MI ability. However, group differences were more pronounced in the imagined condition of the radial Fitts' task. Taken together, the more spatially complex C-VRFT appears to be a more sensitive measure of motor imagery, better discriminating between DCD and TD. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.},

@article{Ifft2011,
abstract = {Fitts' law describes the fundamental trade-off between movement accuracy and speed: it states that the duration of reaching movements is a function of target size (TS) and distance. While Fitts' law has been extensively studied in ergonomics and has guided the design of human-computer interfaces, there have been few studies on its neuronal correlates. To elucidate sensorimotor cortical activity underlying Fitts' law, we implanted two monkeys with multielectrode arrays in the primary motor (M1) and primary somatosensory (S1) cortices. The monkeys performed reaches with a joystick-controlled cursor toward targets of different size. The reaction time (RT), movement time, and movement velocity changed with TS, and M1 and S1 activity reflected these changes. Moreover, modifications of cortical activity could not be explained by changes of movement parameters alone, but required TS as an additional parameter. Neuronal representation of TS was especially prominent during the early RT period where it influenced the slope of the firing rate rise preceding movement initiation. During the movement period, cortical activity was correlated with movement velocity. Neural decoders were applied to simultaneously decode TS and motor parameters from cortical modulations. We suggest that sensorimotor cortex activity reflects the characteristics of both the movement and the target. Classifiers that extract these parameters from cortical ensembles could improve neuroprosthetic control.},

@phdthesis{MacKenzie1992,
abstract = {The theoretical basis for Fitts' law is developed and extended. Several modifications are claimed to improve the model's prediction power in general, and to extend its applicability to movement tasks common on today's interactive computer systems. Original contributions include (a) a correction to the model based on a direct analogy with Shannon's Theorem 17, (b) two methods for accommodating approach angle in the calculation of task difficulty, and (c) an extension of the model to dragging tasks and compound pointing-plus-dragging tasks.

In a re-analysis of published data from experiments by Fitts' and others, the Shannon formulation is shown to provided higher correlations than the Fitts or Welford formulation, particularly when task conditions extend under 3 bits. It is demonstrated that the Shannon formulation cannot yield a negative rating for task difficulty, unlike the Fitts or Welford formulation.

Three experiments were conducted. In the first, the mouse, tablet-with-stylus, and trackball were tested on serial pointing and dragging tasks. Model comparisons provided moderate additional evidence of an improved fit using the Shannon formulation. Using the index of performance (in bits/s) as the criterion, the tablet-with-stylus and mouse performed similarly during the pointing tasks; but the tablet-with-stylus was slightly better than the mouse during dragging. The trackball was a poor performer for both tasks.

In the second experiment, the mouse was used in a two-dimensional point-select task with rectangular targets. Two models performed significantly better than the status quo model – one substituting for target width the smaller of the target's width or height (the "smaller-of" model), the other substituting the span of the target along an approach vector through the target's centre (the W' model).

In the third experiment, the mouse was tested in a point-drag-select task. Observations support the claim that Fitts' law can model both pointing and dragging operations, even when they occur as a point-select (button-down) action followed by a drag-select (button-up) action.},

@article{Smits-Engelsman2003,
abstract = {Thirty-two children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) and learning disabilities (LD) and their age-matched controls attending normal primary schools were investigated using kinematic movement analysis of fine-motor performance. Three hypotheses about the nature of the motor deficits observed in children with LD were tested: general slowness hypothesis, limited information capacity hypothesis, and the motor control mode hypothesis. Measures of drawing movements were analyzed under different task conditions using a Fitts' paradigm. In a reciprocal aiming task, the children drew straight-line segments between two targets 2.5 cm apart. Three Target Sizes were used (0.22, 0.44, and 0.88 cm). Children used an electronic pen that left no trace on the writing tablet. To manipulate the degree of open-loop movement control, the aiming task was performed under two different control regimes: discrete aiming and cyclic aiming. The kinematic analysis of the writing movements of the 32 children with DCD/LD that took part in the experimental study confirmed that besides learning disabilities they have a motor learning problem as well. Overall, the two groups did not differ in response time, nor did they respond differently according to Fitts' Law. Both groups displayed a conventional trade-off between Target Size and average Movement Time. However, while movement errors for children with DCD/LD were minimal on the discrete task, they made significantly more errors on the cyclic task. This, together with faster endpoint velocities, suggests a reduced ability to use a control strategy that emphasizes the terminal control of accuracy. Taken together, the results suggest that children with DCD/LD rely more on feedback during movement execution and have difficulty switching to a feedforward or open-loop strategy. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Wilson2001,
abstract = {In an earlier study using the visually guided pointing task (VGPT) the authors showed that the timing of imagined movement sequences in children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) does not conform to the conventional speed-for-accuracy trade-off (or Fitts' law [P.M. Fitts, Journal of Experimental Psychology 47 (1954) 381-391]) that occurs when the distance and accuracy requirements of movements are varied [P. Maruff, P.H. Wilson, M. Trebilcock, J. Currie, Neuropsychologia 37 (1999b) 1317-1324]. The present study sought to replicate this earlier finding and to examine (using a weight manipulation) whether this deficit was also attributable to inaccurate programming of relative force. The chronometry of real and imagined movements was investigated in a group of 20 children with DCD aged between 8 and 12 years and a group of controls matched on age and verbal IQ (VIQ). Movement duration was tested for real and imagined movements using the preferred hand, with the VGPT performed under two load conditions: with and without the addition of a weight attached to a pen. Group means of each subjects' mean movement duration were calculated and plotted against target width for each of the four conditions [Movement type (2)×Load (2)] and a logarithmic curve was fitted to the data points. In the control group, the speed-for-accuracy trade-off for both real and imagined performance conformed to Fitts' law under each load condition. In the DCD group only real movements conformed to Fitts' law. Moreover, the effect of load differed between groups - for real movements, movement duration did not differ between load and no-load conditions for either group, while for imagined movements, movement duration increased under the load condition for the control group only. These results replicate and extend the results of our earlier study. This pattern of performance suggests that children with DCD have an impairment in the ability to generate internal representations of volitional movements which may reflect an impaired ability to process efference copy signals. The ability to programme both relative force and timing appears to underly this difficulty. Results have implications for the use of (guided) motor imagery training in order to facilitate the development of motor skill in children with DCD. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},
