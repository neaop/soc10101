\section{Literature Review}
	\subsection{Introduction}
		\texttt{Explain that there is very little existing literature for Dyslexia Diagnoses using Fitts's - but that it has been used to previously to identify other learning and congestive difficulties}\\
		While Fitts's Law has existed for around 60 years, it's use as an identification tool in that time has been very limited, with most papers focusing on its original intention - Human Computer Interaction. There exists only a small number of papers where Fitts's Analysis has been used as an attempt to identify children with Cognitive Development and Motor Skill issues.
	
	\subsection{Disability Detection with Fitts's Law}
		\texttt{Discuss and evaluate papers where Fitts's analysis is used for detection}
		
	\subsection{Dyslexia Detection}
