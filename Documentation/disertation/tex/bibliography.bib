abstract = {The ability to volitionally control motor imagery was investigated by comparing the chronometry of real and imagined movements in a patient (AB) with conversion disorder who presented with paralysis of the left arm and hand and in a patient (MM) with an actual injury to the left arm. Control experiments investigated voluntary control of motor imagery in a group of healthy individuals who feigned a motor impairment with one limb and in one group who were instructed to move carefully and slowly. The visually guided pointing task was used to investigate the speed for accuracy trade-offs that occur as target size is varied for both real and imagined performance. In the healthy individuals, the speed for accuracy trade-off for both real and imagined performance on the motor task conformed to Fitts' law provided both the speed and accuracy of movements was emphasised. In MM, real and imagined performance was also within normal limits despite considerable pain and discomfort. In AB and in subjects feigning a motor impairment, motor task performance with the affected limb was slow and did not conform to Fitts' law. However, although imagined performance with the affected limb was generally slower than with the unaffected limb, it did conform to Fitts' law. These results suggest subjects cannot anticipate the effects of an actual limb injury. Furthermore, while they are able to control the general duration of imagined movements they have little voluntary control over their relative timing. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Aim: this study aimed to characterize the fine motor, sensory and perceptive function of school-aged children with dyslexia, learning disabilities and learning difficulties and to correlate these results with the analysis of the children's handwriting. Method: participants were 80 2nd to 4th graders, ranging in age from 7 to 12 years, of both genders, divided as follows: GI: composed of 20 students with dyslexia, GII: composed of 20 students with learning disabilities, GIII: composed of 20 students with learning difficulties and GIV: composed of 20 good readers. All of the children were submitted to an assessment of the fine motor, sensorial and perceptive functions using the Dysgraphia Scale. Results: the results indicated that most groups presented a poor performance in tests of FMF7 (fingers opposition), S8 (graphestesia) and P1 (body imitation). GI and GII were the groups that presented the worst performance in most of the tests when compared to GIII and GIV. Regarding handwriting, it was observed that all of the children in GII are dysgraphics. Conclusion: the presence of motor, sensorial and perceptive alterations is a characteristic of children with learning disabilities and dyslexia. However this characteristic may or may not be found in children with learning difficulties, therefore motor, sensorial and perceptive alterations are responsible for the dysgraphic behavior observed in the children with learning disabilities of the present study.},

abstract = {Despite the increasing interest in dyslexia in the literature, debates still surround theories about the causes of dyslexia and efficient methods of detection. One major theory of dyslexia is the General Sensorimotor Theory (Stein, 2001; Ramus, 2003), which hypothesises that visual and auditory processing, and motor/tactile aspects contribute to the causes of dyslexia. This study aims to test the “Dot-to-Dot” (DtD) task as a potential screening tool for primary school children. This study will address the visual-spatial-motor integration debate, testing for the notion that the general sensorimotor aspects are sufficient to identify dyslexia. The DtD task will be compared with an existing screening tool (LUCID Rapid), other phonological awareness tasks, and general intelligence measures. Participants were in the P1 and P3 classes of Castleview Primary School, recruited through City of Edinburgh Council. The 68 participants were between the ages of 4 years and 8 years. Testing took place at the school in two separate sessions. The first session tested children on the DtD and LUCID software, and the second session tested children on cognitive aspects using subtests from Wechsler's Intelligence Tests (WPPSI {\&} WISC) as well as the Dyslexia Early Screening Test (Version II, Fawcett {\&} Nicolson, 2004). Correlational and regressional analyses revealed that generally, the DtD can be shown to add prediction to phonological awareness scores. The DtD can differentiate between ‘high' and ‘low' risk children with dyslexia, as classified by LUCID Rapid. Therefore, this suggests that this task could potentially be used to detect children at risk of developing dyslexia, with more detailed research.},

abstract = {Developmental dyslexia is a heterogeneous syndrome with a phonological core deficit and frequent association with other developmental disorders. Controversies exist about the influence of motor difficulties frequently encountered in dyslexia. According to different theoretical approaches, these motor impairments would reflect either a frequent co-morbid entity or a cerebellar dysfunction that could constitute the causal factor of reading disabilities. The principal aim of this study was to determine the frequency of motor impairments in a population of children with phonological dyslexia and specify possible links with attention deficit. We analysed retrospectively motor and attention abilities of 58 children with phonological dyslexia. An important sub-group of children with dyslexia (40-57{\%} depending on the severity of motor difficulties) presented a motor impairment affecting co-ordination, balance and manual dexterity suggesting a cerebellar dysfunction. There was a significant association between attention deficit and motor impairments, with a specific impact on balance and co-ordination deficits. The comparison of performance in four groups defined according to the presence versus absence of attention deficit and motor impairment, respectively, were not in favour of a unequivocal causal link between reading disabilities and motor or attention disorders. {\textcopyright} 2007 European Paediatric Neurology Society.},

Additional theoretical and empirical advances are suggested to this already strong research base. In particular, there is a need is for experimental work elucidating the nature of naming speed deficits and providing independent evidence of the automaticity of rapid naming. The second part of the review considers evidence for deficits in motor automaticity in dyslexic children. Here, a more mixed pattern of results is evident. It is concluded that there is currently clearer evidence for language-based than motor-based automaticity deficits. Future motor automaticity research is likely to require the routine screening of poor readers for common co-occurring developmental difficulties, improved sampling and prospective longitudinal studies.},

abstract = {The theoretical basis for Fitts' law is developed and extended. Several modifications are claimed to improve the model's prediction power in general, and to extend its applicability to movement tasks common on today's interactive computer systems. Original contributions include (a) a correction to the model based on a direct analogy with Shannon's Theorem 17, (b) two methods for accommodating approach angle in the calculation of task difficulty, and (c) an extension of the model to dragging tasks and compound pointing-plus-dragging tasks.

In a re-analysis of published data from experiments by Fitts' and others, the Shannon formulation is shown to provided higher correlations than the Fitts or Welford formulation, particularly when task conditions extend under 3 bits. It is demonstrated that the Shannon formulation cannot yield a negative rating for task difficulty, unlike the Fitts or Welford formulation.

Three experiments were conducted. In the first, the mouse, tablet-with-stylus, and trackball were tested on serial pointing and dragging tasks. Model comparisons provided moderate additional evidence of an improved fit using the Shannon formulation. Using the index of performance (in bits/s) as the criterion, the tablet-with-stylus and mouse performed similarly during the pointing tasks; but the tablet-with-stylus was slightly better than the mouse during dragging. The trackball was a poor performer for both tasks.

In the second experiment, the mouse was used in a two-dimensional point-select task with rectangular targets. Two models performed significantly better than the status quo model – one substituting for target width the smaller of the target's width or height (the "smaller-of" model), the other substituting the span of the target along an approach vector through the target's centre (the W' model).

In the third experiment, the mouse was tested in a point-drag-select task. Observations support the claim that Fitts' law can model both pointing and dragging operations, even when they occur as a point-select (button-down) action followed by a drag-select (button-up) action.},

@article{Wilson2001,
abstract = {In an earlier study using the visually guided pointing task (VGPT) the authors showed that the timing of imagined movement sequences in children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) does not conform to the conventional speed-for-accuracy trade-off (or Fitts' law [P.M. Fitts, Journal of Experimental Psychology 47 (1954) 381-391]) that occurs when the distance and accuracy requirements of movements are varied [P. Maruff, P.H. Wilson, M. Trebilcock, J. Currie, Neuropsychologia 37 (1999b) 1317-1324]. The present study sought to replicate this earlier finding and to examine (using a weight manipulation) whether this deficit was also attributable to inaccurate programming of relative force. The chronometry of real and imagined movements was investigated in a group of 20 children with DCD aged between 8 and 12 years and a group of controls matched on age and verbal IQ (VIQ). Movement duration was tested for real and imagined movements using the preferred hand, with the VGPT performed under two load conditions: with and without the addition of a weight attached to a pen. Group means of each subjects' mean movement duration were calculated and plotted against target width for each of the four conditions [Movement type (2)×Load (2)] and a logarithmic curve was fitted to the data points. In the control group, the speed-for-accuracy trade-off for both real and imagined performance conformed to Fitts' law under each load condition. In the DCD group only real movements conformed to Fitts' law. Moreover, the effect of load differed between groups - for real movements, movement duration did not differ between load and no-load conditions for either group, while for imagined movements, movement duration increased under the load condition for the control group only. These results replicate and extend the results of our earlier study. This pattern of performance suggests that children with DCD have an impairment in the ability to generate internal representations of volitional movements which may reflect an impaired ability to process efference copy signals. The ability to programme both relative force and timing appears to underly this difficulty. Results have implications for the use of (guided) motor imagery training in order to facilitate the development of motor skill in children with DCD. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) have difficulty imagining movements such that they conform to the customary temporal constraints of real performance. We examined whether this ability is influenced by the choice of task used to elicit motor imagery (MI). Performance of typically developing (TD) (. n=. 30) and children with DCD (. n=. 30) was compared on two tasks: the Visually Guided Pointing Task (VGPT) and the Computerized Virtual Radial Fitts Task (C-VRFT). Since the VGPT places higher demands on executive functions like working memory but requires less spatial planning, we reasoned that the C-VRFT would provide a purer measure of motor imagery (or simulation). Based on our earlier work, we predicted that imagery deficits in DCD would more likely manifest on the C-VRFT. Results showed high correlations between tasks in terms of executed and imagined movement time suggest that both tasks measure MI ability. However, group differences were more pronounced in the imagined condition of the radial Fitts' task. Taken together, the more spatially complex C-VRFT appears to be a more sensitive measure of motor imagery, better discriminating between DCD and TD. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.},

@article{Ifft2011,
abstract = {Fitts' law describes the fundamental trade-off between movement accuracy and speed: it states that the duration of reaching movements is a function of target size (TS) and distance. While Fitts' law has been extensively studied in ergonomics and has guided the design of human-computer interfaces, there have been few studies on its neuronal correlates. To elucidate sensorimotor cortical activity underlying Fitts' law, we implanted two monkeys with multielectrode arrays in the primary motor (M1) and primary somatosensory (S1) cortices. The monkeys performed reaches with a joystick-controlled cursor toward targets of different size. The reaction time (RT), movement time, and movement velocity changed with TS, and M1 and S1 activity reflected these changes. Moreover, modifications of cortical activity could not be explained by changes of movement parameters alone, but required TS as an additional parameter. Neuronal representation of TS was especially prominent during the early RT period where it influenced the slope of the firing rate rise preceding movement initiation. During the movement period, cortical activity was correlated with movement velocity. Neural decoders were applied to simultaneously decode TS and motor parameters from cortical modulations. We suggest that sensorimotor cortex activity reflects the characteristics of both the movement and the target. Classifiers that extract these parameters from cortical ensembles could improve neuroprosthetic control.},

@article{Smits-Engelsman2003,
abstract = {Thirty-two children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) and learning disabilities (LD) and their age-matched controls attending normal primary schools were investigated using kinematic movement analysis of fine-motor performance. Three hypotheses about the nature of the motor deficits observed in children with LD were tested: general slowness hypothesis, limited information capacity hypothesis, and the motor control mode hypothesis. Measures of drawing movements were analyzed under different task conditions using a Fitts' paradigm. In a reciprocal aiming task, the children drew straight-line segments between two targets 2.5 cm apart. Three Target Sizes were used (0.22, 0.44, and 0.88 cm). Children used an electronic pen that left no trace on the writing tablet. To manipulate the degree of open-loop movement control, the aiming task was performed under two different control regimes: discrete aiming and cyclic aiming. The kinematic analysis of the writing movements of the 32 children with DCD/LD that took part in the experimental study confirmed that besides learning disabilities they have a motor learning problem as well. Overall, the two groups did not differ in response time, nor did they respond differently according to Fitts' Law. Both groups displayed a conventional trade-off between Target Size and average Movement Time. However, while movement errors for children with DCD/LD were minimal on the discrete task, they made significantly more errors on the cyclic task. This, together with faster endpoint velocities, suggests a reduced ability to use a control strategy that emphasizes the terminal control of accuracy. Taken together, the results suggest that children with DCD/LD rely more on feedback during movement execution and have difficulty switching to a feedforward or open-loop strategy. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Four devices are evaluated with respect to how rapidly they can be used to select text on a CRT display. The mouse is found to be fastest on all counts and also to have the lowest error rates. It is shown that variations in positioning time with the mouse and joystick are accounted for by Fitts' Law. In the case of the mouse, the measured Fitts's Law slope constant is close to that found in other eye-hand tasks leading to the conclusion that positioning time with this device is almost the minimal achievable. Positioning time for key devices is shown to be proportional to the number of keystrokes which must be typed.},
