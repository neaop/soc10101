abstract = {The prediction of movement time in human-computer interfaces as undertaken using Fitts' law is reviewed. Techniques for model building are summarized and three refinements to improve the theoretical and empirical accuracy of the law are presented. Refinements include (1) the Shannon formulation for the index of task difficulty, (2) new interpretations of "target width" for two- and three-dimensional tasks, and (3) a technique for normalizing error rates across experimental factors. Finally, a detailed application example is developed showing the potential of Fitts' law to predict and compare the performance of user interfaces before designs are finalized.},
